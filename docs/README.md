## 1. User Experience
### a. Purpose of the Website

This is a web application designed to help people formulate ongoing exercise plans with the help of AI taking in to account any injuries or limitations, such as a long term knee injury. The application also strives to create a community where you can follow people and comment on their profiles and traning plans. The idea is that the site will be a positivie place that helps people stay fit, healthy, happy and connected, even if they have injures and/or long term limitations in their exercise. The site is designed to one day make it compatible with smart watches (eg Garmin or Apple) to be able to upload your exercise plan on to your watch to follow.

### b. User Stories

#### First Story

User A has a long term knee injury that means they avoid jumpling and high impact exercises. Every exercise plan they find online seems to suggest this as part of their routines and they are looking for a plan that will adapt to their speicific needs.

 - They needs to be able to tell the AI that generates the plan about their specific exercise needs for a plan.
 - It is useful for them if the site can remember their injury and build long term progression goals/plans.

#### Second Story

User B enjoys personally adapted plans but also wants to reach out to other people, connect and talk about the challenges they face exercising.

- They need to be able to hold back to back conversations with people on comments

#### Third Story

User C is part of a friendship group that enjoy exercise. They want to be able to see and discuss their friends' plans.

- They need to be able to find the profiles they follow easily and comment on profiles.

#### Fourth Story

User D is an influencer with a community of followers. They want to be able to show their followers the plans they are following.

- They need to be able to exapnd on their profile to communicate to their followers.
- They also need to be able to comment on their own profiles as well as other peoples to help engagement.


### c. Wireframes

I tried to keep the design of the site fairly simple and this is reflected in the wireframes. 

#### Links to Wireframes

[Connections Page](docs/docs-images/wireframes/connections-page.png)

 - Note that this page changes, if you are not signed in it shows all profiles, but in the same design as the connections page.

### d. Accessibility

Because the site is based around the idea of people having limitations with exercise I feel that accessibility is really important to the ethos of this site. Therefore I have designed a high contrast colour palette, a clear design and have taken in to account screen readers. I have also ensured you can navigate the site using the keyboard.

### e. Colour Palette

The colour scheme for this site was chosen to look smart and professional, but also score strongly for contrast and accessibility.

### f. Fonts

For this project I used Google Fonts Jost, designed to be clear and readable.

### g. Features

The site has several features.

The primary feature is the ability to create bespoke training plans that take injuries or limitations in to account. The plans are created by AI powered by Anthropic. The information for the plans is gathered on people's profiles and a short generation plan form, then used by the AI to design plans.

It also allows users to follow other people and be followed by other people. This is useful if you want to see other traning plans or get an understanding of other people's exercise routines. You follow someone from a button on the public version of their profile. They can approve the request.

![example of a page with followers and following profiles listed](docs/docs-images/follow-example.png)

You can comment on profiles to communicate with each other, and the comments have full CRUD functionality.

![example of a comment with CRUD buttons showing](docs/docs-images/comment-example.png)

There are search buttons for target events and usernames. These both work if you enter one word that is found in a profile's username or target event. For example, if you search 'Brighton' in the goal event it will flag anyone who has a goal of 'Brighton Marathon' or 'Brighton 10k.'

## 2. Database Desgin

I tried to keep that data as simple as possible. This project could be quite complicated because there is data entered by the user, as well as data generated by the AI. The other reason for striving for simpicity is to try and keep the AI call as simple as possible to keep costs down.

### a. ERD Diagrams

I have drawn an ERD diagram to explore the relationships between the different sets of data. I have tried to keep it simple, the different fields are broken down in more detail in the schemas.

### b. Schemas

I have drawn a diagram to illustrate the schemas for the different database models.

## 3. Technologies Used

I have used Celery to handle the async tasks while making the API calls. I have used Redis to act as a messenger with Celery.

### a. Software Used

The site is built using Python, HTML and CSS on Django. There is a full list of sofware dependencies and current versions in the requirements.txt file.

### b. APIs Used

The site uses Anthropic AI API, model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001. The software associated with it sometimes needs updating.

### c. Other Code Credits

## 4. Deployment Information

### a. Version Control

Regular Commits have been made to github, the url is [link to github repo](https://github.com/christinalicence/stride).

### b. Deploy to Heroku

The site is deployed through Heroku. Seperate Dynos are used for hosting the site and running the API call process.

Before deploying ensure

- Debug is set to false in settings.py
- No secrets are committed, API keys, Database urls and secret keys are all stored in .env, which is included in gitignore, so not on the github repo.
- All the config vars are set correctly in Heroku. The site needs a database url, a Django secret key, Redis url, Anthropic API key and Cloudinary API key to be working on there.

Once this is done. 

Run the commands to update the github repo 
 > git add .
 > git commit -m 'change you have made'
 > git push

Then when logged in on Heroku go to the deplyment section to 'Deploy Branch,' then to 'Open App.' This should open an up to date version of Stride. 

For error checking use the logs in Heroku.

### c. Clone the Code Locally

In order to undertake any work on the site the code can be cloned locally from github. The url to do this is [gituhb code url](https://github.com/christinalicence/stride.git). You can enter this to VSCode to clone it. 

## 5. Testing (See seperate Testing.md file)

See Testing.md file for an expalanation of how the site has worked against the user stories, the automated testing strategy and manual testing that has been carried out.

## 6. Security Concerns.

The API key for Anthropic, databse url, Django secret key and Redis key are all stored in .env and have been included in my gitignore, so not uploaded to github.

A security concern tht is ongoing is not having email verification (so people could make multiple accounts and overuse the API leading to high costs). This is something I would look to add in the future.


7. ## Improvements for Future Releases

- The biggest plan for the future of this site is to make it compatable with smart watches so that you can save your workouts to the watches and the watches can evaluate your performance during the workouts. This is why the training plans are returned in a json format from the AI, to allow them to be uploaded to a watch or other tracker. You could also do a lighter version by allowing syncing with a phone app.

- I'd like to set up a private messaging system between users. I feel that this would be a useful social aspect for the site.

- I'd like to allow comments to contain photos and for all photos associated with someone's profile to be saved in an area that is easy to access.

- I'd like to be able to widen the comments to include commentting on people's plans.

- I'd like to put proper email verification on to the program to improve security. This is a feature I would add before making the website live.

- I'd like to be able to filter the input that people make to the AI more effectively. I believe there are ways of using the AI to do this, which I would like to explore in the future.

- I would also improve the visual look of the site with more photos and graphics.

9. ## Things I have learnt 

Using the Anthropic AI has been a really interesting learning experience. I have found that it is a little tempremental to work with and you have to refine your code to different outcomes it might give - an example of this is that it is verry inconsistent with how it records rest days. Sometimes it says 'rest days' and sometimes it says 0 or null. I have had to incorporate these different outcomes in to my code to give a consistent user experience.

Another aspect I hadn't really thought about before is the amount of information that goes to and from the AI for this project and how quickly it ouwld add up if the site was live. It could end up quite costly quickly. I think if it was live I would need to limit the amount of API calls per user and implement a payment system (either monthly or a small fee per plan). Obviously if it was paid for I'd be relying on the AI for a consistently good output, although I do think if I could sync it with smartwatches it is a service that people may pay for. 

10. ## Concerns for the future/if I was to put this project live

The thing that would worry me most about putting this project live is the potential for people to make lots of plans and build up the costs for using the AI API. I would look to solve this issue before making the site live.
