## 3. Automated Testing.

I have set up automated tests in django for all views and forms to ensure as comprehensively as possible that these work.

## 4. Test Driven Development

I picked up the principle of test driven development part way through the project. For the 2nd half of the project all tests were adapted or new tests were written when there was any changes in the views or forms.
